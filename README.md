PVPWarn uses both visual and acoustic effects to make the player aware of certain events. The addon aims to be configurable to the players preferences and allows customization on exactly what spells should be brought to the attention of the player and in what form.

## Installation

WoW-Addons are installed directly in your WoW directory:

`[WoW-installation-directory]\Interface\AddOns`

Make sure to get the newest version of the Addon from the releases tab:

[PVPWarn-Releases](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/wow-classic-pvpwarn/releases)

> Note: If the Addon is not showing up in your ingame Addonlist make sure that the Addon is named `PVPWarn` in your Addons folder

## What is PVPWarn?

PVPWarns goal is to help the player recognizing combat log events in a more visual and acoustical way. PVPWarn can display visual and acoustical cues when a certain event is found in the combat log. As an example PVPWarn might play a sound both when an enemy warrior activates recklessness and when it runs out.

## Features of PVPWarn

### Warning

The basic feature of warning the player can be configured for each class and some additional categories such as items, racials and misc.

### Avoiding Spells

PVPWarn can also detect when certain spells where either resisted by the player itself or an enemy player.

#### Self Avoid

The avoid tab allows the configuration of warnings for all spells of a certain category. If you're interested in knowing when you resist a certain spells such as the silence of a shadow priest you will configurate this in the priest category.

#### Enemy Avoid

To configure the resist warning for your own class use the `Enemy Avoid` navigation point. This menu contains all spells for your class that can be resisted and are supported by PVPWarn. If you use a different class the content of that menu is different.

### Profiles

PVPWarn loads a default profile based on your class when the addon loads for the first time. The default profile can be loaded again at any point. If you however start modifying what spells are tracked you can create a new profile or you can even have multiple different profiles that you can then load based on your situation.

## FAQ

#### The Addon is not showing up in WoW. What can I do?

Make sure to recheck the installation part of this Readme and check that the Addon is placed inside `[WoW-installation-directory]\Interface\AddOns` and is correctly named as `PVPWarn`.

#### I get a red error (Lua Error) on my screen. What is this?

This is what we call a Lua error and it usually happens because of an oversight or error by the developer (in this case me). Take a screenshot off the error and create a Github Issue with it and I will see if I can resolve it. It also helps if you can add any additional information of what you we're doing at the time and what other addons you have active. Also if you are able to reproduce the error make sure to check if it still happens if you disable all others addons.

#### PVPWarn spams my chat with messages. How can I deactivate this?

Those obnoxious messages are intended for the development of this addon and means that you download a development version of the addon instead of a proper release. Releases can be downloaded from here - https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/wow-classic-pvpwarn/releases

#### PVPWarn did not warn me about a certain spell. Why?

This can have multiple errors. It might be an actual bug where the addon did not recognize the spell. Before creating a ticket however please make sure to check that the spell is actually configured to show a visual or acoustical warning.

#### PVPWarn does not support my Spell. What can I do?

PVPWarn is not complete and certain spells might have simply forgotten. If you have a certain spell that you would like to see supported in a future version of the addon make sure to create a ticket for it and I will have a  look at it.

## Development

### Switching between Environments

Switching between development and release can be achieved with maven.

```
mvn generate-resources -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P development
```

This generates and overwrites `GM_Environment.lua` and `GearMenu.toc`. You need to specifically specify that you want to overwrite to files to prevent data loss. It is also possible to omit the profile because development is the default profile that will be used.

Switching to release can be done as such:

```
mvn generate-resources -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P release
```

In this case it is mandatory to add the release profile.

**Note:** Switching environments has the effect changing certain files to match an expected value depending on the environment. To be more specific this means that as an example test and debug files are not included when switching to release. It also means that variables such as loglevel change to match the environment.

As to not change those files all the time the repository should always stay in the development environment. Do not commit `GearMenu.toc` and `GM_Environment.lua` in their release state. Changes to those files should always be done inside `build-resources` and their respective template files marked with `.tpl`.

### Packaging the Addon

To package the addon use the `package` phase.

```
mvn package -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P development
```

This generates an addon package for development. For generating a release package the release profile can be used.

```
mvn package -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P release
```

**Note:** This packaging and switching resources can also be done one after another.

**Note:** The packaging is not fit to be used for curseforge because curseforge expects a specific packaging

```
# switch environment to release
mvn generate-resources -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P release
# package release
mvn package -P release
```

### Deploy GitHub Release

Before creating a new release update `addon.tag.version` in `pom.xml`. Afterwards to create a new release and deploy to GitHub the `deploy` profile has to be used.

```
# switch environment to release
mvn generate-resources -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P release
# deploy release
mvn package -P deploy-github
```

For this to work an oauth token for GitHub is required and has to be configured in your `.m2` settings file.

### Deploy CurseForge Release

**Note:** Its best to create the release for GitHub first and only afterwards the curseforge release. That way the tag was already created.

```
# switch environment to release
mvn generate-resources -Dgenerate.sources.overwrite=true -P release
# deploy release
mvn package -P deploy-curseforge
```
