Trinket is SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS

THen depending on the class a different name?

immune_charm/fear/polymorph - rogue
immune_fear/polymorph/stun - priest
immune_root/snare/stun - warrior


This require to rewrite the normalizing function to replace / with _


This happens when a debuff is extended. Check if this works with sheep?
Example player already has vampiric embrace on him. Priest casts it again (duration gets refreshed)
SPELL_AURA_REFRESH

Need a tactic to how to work with certain spells such as touch of weakness

tow triggers when buffed
tow triggers when buff disappears
tow triggers when buff is applied to player (me)


For spells such as kidney shot we need to have a concept how we wanna track/announce them

- Am I interested in just if my target is casting a cheapshot
- Does the cheapshot have to be applied to me?
